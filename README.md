# anomalydetector2
A shared project we did for sophomore year in Bar-Illan-University.
The software learns sequences of training data that consists of columns of attributes, e.g., speed,altitude,wind speed etc.
The program finds the correlation between each pair of attributes and can detect -using some mathematical models- anomalies, in the given data.
The program can interact with the user using the console interface; alternatively the program can reside on a server and the user can make request using a TCP client, following the protocol set by our instructors.
